## ANSI Colors
This is a very simple and silly shell script to print what ANSI colors you would probably want to use for beautifying your plain text output
<br/>
<br/>

### Usage

1. Dowload the script
```
ansi-colors.sh
```

1. Allow execution permission to the downloaded file
```
chmod +x ansi-colors.sh
```

1. Run the file and see the colored output with ANSI code
```
./ansi-colors.sh
```

1. To use specific color, wrap the text ANSI sequence. For instance, to use cyan
```shell
printf "\e[36mHello World\e[0m\n"
```
