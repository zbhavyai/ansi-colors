## ANSI Colors

This is a very simple and silly shell script to print what ANSI colors you would probably want to use for beautifying your plain text output


### Usage

1. Dowload the script
 ```ansi-colors.sh```

2. Allow execution permission to the downloaded file 
```chmod +x ansi-colors.sh```

3. Run the file and see the colored output with ANSI code
```./ansi-colors.sh``` 

4. To use specific color, wrap the text ANSI sequence. For instance, to use cyan
```printf "\e[36mHello World\e[0m\n"```
